					You will note the presence of third party advertisers on the App. In addition, from time to time these advertisers may post their own giveaways, contests and surveys or requests for registration. If you respond, in any way, to an advertiser tile, banner, contest, giveaway, survey or link in this App, this Privacy Policy may not apply and you will then be subject to the privacy policy, terms, conditions and copyright policies of the advertiser’s website and governing policies, divisions or bodies. For example, I do not control how third party advertisers use cookies that originate from their own websites even if linked from this App.<br /><br />
				
					I use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit this App. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this App and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.
